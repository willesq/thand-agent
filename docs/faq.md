### What is Thand Agent?

Thand Agent is an open-source privilege access management (PAM) and just-in-time access (JIT) solution for cloud infrastructure, SaaS applications, and local systems. It eliminates standing privileges by providing temporary access only when needed, automatically revoking permissions when tasks are complete.

### How does Thand improve security?

Thand addresses several critical security issues:
- **Eliminates static credentials** that can be leaked or compromised
- **Removes over-privileged users** by granting only necessary permissions
- **Provides complete audit trails** for compliance and security monitoring
- **Prevents persistent threats** by automatically revoking access
- **Reduces attack surface** through zero standing privileges

### What's the difference between Thand Agent, Server, and Cloud?

- **Thand Agent**: Runs on your local machine, manages sessions and provides authentication
- **Thand Server**: Deployed in your infrastructure, acts as a "login server" for access requests
- **Thand Cloud**: Optional proprietary service that provides centralized management, AI insights, and analytics
