{: .note }
By default thand will authenticate to **auth.thand.io** but you can specify your own server.
Your administrator will provide the server URL. If you are setting this up in your own environment you will need to first deploy the Thand server in your environment.
Please see the [Environment Setup](../environments/) for more information.

## Installation

### Install via script

```bash
# Install agent (https://github.com/thand-io/agent/blob/main/scripts/install.sh). Trust but verify!
curl -sSL https://get.thand.io | sh
```

### Install via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew tap thand-io/tap
brew install thand
```

### Install via Binary Release

Download the latest binary for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/thand-io/agent/releases) page:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
curl -L -o thand https://github.com/thand-io/agent/releases/latest/download/agent-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)
chmod +x thand
sudo mv thand /usr/local/bin/
```

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/thand-io/agent/releases/latest/download/agent-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "thand.exe"
```

### Build from Source

Before installing Thand Agent, ensure you have:

- Go 1.21 or later (if building from source)
- Access to your target infrastructure (GCP, AWS, etc.)

Clone the repository and build the agent:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thand-io/agent.git
cd agent
make submodules
make build
```

The binary will be available at `bin/agent`.

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Create a configuration file at `~/.thand/config.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  url: "https://your-thand-server.com"
  
agent:
  listen_port: 8080
  session_timeout: "1h"
  
logging:
  level: "info"
  format: "json"
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure the agent using environment variables:

```bash
export THAND_SERVER_URL="https://your-thand-server.com"
export THAND_AGENT_PORT="8080"
export THAND_LOG_LEVEL="info"
```

---

## First Steps

### 1. Authenticate

Initialize your authentication with the Thand server:

```bash
thand login
```

Or via a thand login server.

```bash
thand login --server http://localhost:9090
```

This will open your browser for authentication or provide a device code flow. Once authenticated, your session will be cached locally. You can view your current session with:

```bash
thand sessions
```

### 3. Request Access

Request access to a resource:

```bash
# Request AWS access for 1 hour
thand request --provider aws-prod --role Admin --duration 1h --reason "Deploying new version"

# Request GCP access
thand request --provider gcp --project my-project --role viewer

# Request via natural language
thand "Get me admin access to AWS production for 2 hours to perform maintenance"
```

### 4. Use Your Access

Once approved, the agent will provide temporary credentials:

```bash
# AWS credentials are automatically configured
aws s3 ls

# GCP credentials are set via environment
gcloud projects list
```

---

## Common Use Cases

### Local Sudo Access

Request temporary sudo access on your local machine:

```bash
thand-agent request sudo --duration 30m --reason "System maintenance"
```
