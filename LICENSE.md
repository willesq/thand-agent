## Terms

Licensed Work: The software in this repository.

Licensor: Thand, Inc.

Change Date: 2029-01-01

Change License: Apache License, Version 2.0

## Additional Usage Grant

You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided Your use does not include offering the Licensed Work to third parties on a hosted or embedded basis in order to compete with Thand’s paid version(s) of the Licensed Work, or management and control platforms of that work. For purposes of this license:

A “competitive offering” is a Product that is offered to third parties on a paid basis, including through paid support arrangements, that significantly overlaps with the capabilities of Thand’s paid or enterprise version(s) of the Licensed Work. If Your Product is not a competitive offering when You first make it generally available, it will not become a competitive offering later due to Thand releasing a new version of the Licensed Work with additional capabilities. Products that are provided for free or on an unpaid basis are still considered a competitive offering if they offer capabilities that significantly overlap with Thand’s paid or enterprise version(s) of the Licensed Work.

“Product” means software that is offered to end users to manage in their own environments or offered as a service on a hosted basis.

“Embedded” means including the source code or executable code from the Licensed Work in a competitive offering. “Embedded” also means packaging the competitive offering in such a way that the Licensed Work must be accessed or downloaded for the competitive offering to operate.

Hosting or using the Licensed Work(s) for internal purposes within an organization is not considered a competitive offering. Thand considers your organization to include all of your affiliates under common control.

## Change License

On the Change Date, the Licensed Work will be made available under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

## Definitions

- **Production Use**: Any use of the Licensed Work to provide services to third parties, or for internal business operations beyond evaluation, testing, or development.
- **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**: The total recurring revenue normalized to a one-year period, including all subscription fees, recurring service fees, and other predictable revenue streams.
